# Reinforcement Learning

A repository of theory from the book `Reinforcement Learning` and coding examples and games to implement the theory. Also a testbed for random games and implementations of various algorithms regarding reinforcement learning

This repository is something I'm throwing together for my own reference. Most text is auto generated by LLMs or written by me and all images are referenced from whatever images were available in google search.

Most theory is not my own and will come from excellent sources such as:

- Reinforcement Learning (an introduction, second edition - Richard S. Sutton and Anrew G. Barto)
- OpenAI gym and resources
- LLMs and other AI tools for writing and building code examples

## Requirements

- Xming (Windows - optional)   
- Virtualenv (to load the "gym" python libraries stored in the "gym" folder)
- WSL2 (Windows - optional)  

## Setup

In your desired terminal install the conda environment  

```
conda install .
```

Activate the conda environment `gym` and test that your environment works (some linux packages may be missing).

## Startup

I am still deciding how to launch my openai gym projects.

Not using docker; we avoid needing nvidia docker  
Using conda; can switch between windows and ubuntu builds more easily
Running Xming, can run in ubuntu/WSL if we need an output device

### Launch (windows)

- Startup Xming by running config.xlaunch to support an output device  

- From your desired terminal export your output device to id 0  for Xming  

- Activate your project conda environment  

```
conda activate gym
```

- Write/run your agents using python
